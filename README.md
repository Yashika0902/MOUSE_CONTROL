# MOUSE_CONTROL
Gesture-controlled mouse control is an intuitive system that enables users to navigate and interact with their computer using hand gestures. By tracking the movements of the user's hands or fingers, it translates gestures into corresponding cursor movements, clicks, and scrolling actions, offering a hands-free and immersive computing experience.
